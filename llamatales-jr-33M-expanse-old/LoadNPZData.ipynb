He wanted to reach the highest point of the pole. As he was trying, he said to himself, \"I will get to the pole quickly!\" But his friend, a bird named Sam, said, \"Wait, Blaze. Be careful! That pole is very high and very steep.\"\\n\\nBlaze did not listen to Sam. He kept climbing up the pole. He climbed and climbed until he was almost at the top. When he got there, he was very happy and said, \"I did it!\" But then, Blaze lost his footing and fell from the pole. He was very hurt.\\n\\nBert was very sad. He said, \"Why didn\\'t you listen to my warning, Blaze?\" Blaze said, \"Because I wanted to be the bravest dragon and climb that tall pole.\" The people who lived nearby saw Blaze crying and they said, \"Oh no! A big dragon is hurt!\" They took Blaze to the hospital and made him feel better.'"
