    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing certain parameters in a machine learning model to improve the model's performance. These parameters are not learned from the data but are determined before the model training process begins. In practice, choosing the right hyperparameter values can significantly enhance the model's accuracy and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optuna is an open-source framework for automating hyperparameter tuning. Using Bayesian optimization methods, Optuna provides an efficient and straightforward way to find the best set of hyperparameters. One of Optuna's main advantages is its ability to manage the tuning process dynamically, allowing users to adaptively optimize hyperparameters based on previous experiment results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Bayesian Optimization, Optuna also supports Grid Search, Random Search, Pruning, Multi-objective Optimization, and Hyperband to accelerate the tuning process. By combining these techniques, Optuna can efficiently and effectively optimize hyperparameters for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will discuss how to perform hyperparameter tuning using Optuna with a case study on the XGBoost model. However, the principles and methods used can be applied to other machine learning models, including deep learning models built with TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as models from libraries like Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, and CatBoost."

    "\n",
    "The code below is used to prepare the data, starting from reading the dataset, preprocessing the data, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. In the dataset, there is an `id` column that only contains data order and is not related to modeling, so it can be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, determine the feature columns and also the target variable column. The target variable is located in the last column, which is `quality`. This column contains values `LOW` or `HIGH`, indicating the class of the observation. There are 11 other columns, all of which are numeric, and these will be used to predict the `quality` class. Since the class labels are still in text form, they need to be converted into numeric values, for example, using 0 for the `LOW` class and 1 for the `HIGH` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to split the data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function. Here, we use 70 percent for training data and 30 percent for testing data."

    "# XGBoost Model Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are key components that influence the performance of an XGBoost model. Below are some of the hyperparameters in the XGBoost model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **eta** or **learning_rate**: Controls the step size when updating weights. Lower values make the training process slower but more stable. Conversely, if set too high, the model may miss important patterns in the data.\n",
    "- **max_depth**: The maximum limit on the depth of the tree. The deeper the tree, the more complex the model, and the higher the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "- **n_estimators**: The number of trees to be built in the boosting model.\n",
    "- **subsample**: The proportion of data samples used to train each tree.\n",
    "- **colsample_bytree**: The proportion of features used for node splitting.\n",
    "- **min_child_weight**: The minimum weight of a tree leaf. This parameter prevents overfitting by setting a minimum threshold for the number of examples required to split a node.\n",
    "- **gamma**: A threshold for making splits on the leaf node. Higher gamma values can make the model too simple, leading to a loss in its ability to capture the complexity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these seven parameters, there are other parameters that can also be controlled for XGBoost model training. More details can be found in the official documentation at [**XGBoost Parameters — xgboost 2.1.0 documentation**.](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parameter.html)"

    "# Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, not all model hyperparameters need to be tuned. We can apply tuning to only a few parameters, while others can be set directly or use their default values. In this example, we will focus on tuning the hyperparameters mentioned earlier, namely `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`, `min_child_weight`, and `gamma`. Feel free to adjust or reduce the number of hyperparameters if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tuning process, the first step is to create an objective function. This function contains a list of model hyperparameters and the corresponding search value ranges. For integer-type parameters such as maximum tree depth (`max_depth`) and the number of trees (`n_estimators`), we can define the values using the `suggest_int` function. Meanwhile, for parameters with decimal values, such as `learning_rate`, we use the `suggest_float` function. Additionally, if there are categorical parameters (for example, the optimizer parameter in neural network models), they can be set up using the `suggest_categorical` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still within the objective function, we initiate the XGBoost model with the predefined parameters. Next, to evaluate the model's performance, we will use the k-fold cross-validation technique with 3 folds. The return value of the objective function is the average score based on this evaluation. By default, the evaluation metric used in classification problems is accuracy. However, other metrics can be used, such as `balanced_accuracy`, `average_precision`, `f1`, and so on (refer to [**Metrics and Scoring**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html))."
